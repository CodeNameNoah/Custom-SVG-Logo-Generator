# Custom-SVG-Logo-Generator

Hello, I am excited to introduce you to my custom SVG logo generator! With this tool, you can create a unique logo that represents your brand or personal style in just a few easy steps.

My logo generator works by asking you a series of questions about your preferences. You will start by entering 1-3 letters that you want to include in your logo. Based on your input, the generator will produce a range of logo designs for you to choose from.

## Description

First, enter the letters you want to include in your logo. This can be anything from your initials to a specific acronym or word. Once you have entered your letters, the application will generate a variety of logo designs based on your input.

Next, you will be prompted to select the color scheme for your logo. The application uses the npm inquirer package to ask you a series of questions about your color preferences. You can input the name of a color keyword, such as "blue" or "red," or you can enter a hexadecimal color key for more specific color choices. You can also choose the color of the text and the background separately.

Once you have chosen your color scheme, the application will generate a variety of logo designs for you to choose from. You can select the one that you like the most, or you can continue to generate more designs until you find one that suits your needs.

Finally, when you are satisfied with your logo design, you can export it as an SVG file. This file can be used for a variety of purposes, such as creating business cards, website designs, or even merchandise.

Thank you for using my logo generating application! I hope you enjoy creating your own custom logos with it.
